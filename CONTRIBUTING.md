## Contributing Code

### Install dependencies

Univer requires Node.js >= 18.17.0. We recommend using nvm or fnm to switch between different versions of Node.js.

```shell
git clone http://github.com/dream-num/univer
cd univer

# install package manager pnpm
npm i -g pnpm

# install dependencies
pnpm install

```

### Start dev server

```shell
pnpm dev:demo
```

### Architecture

Please refer to the architecture doc. The [Chinese version](https://univer.ai/guides/architecture/architecture/).

### Source code organization

The file structure of a plugin should be organized as follows:

```
|- common/
|- models/
|- services/
|- commands/
  |- commands/
  |- mutations/
  |- operations/
|- controllers/
|- views/
  |- components/
  |- parts/
|- plugin.ts
|- index.ts
```

There are some limits on what paths could a file import from.

-   common cannot import file in other folders
-   models can only import files from common
-   services can only import files from models and common
-   commands can only import files from common, models and services

During the refactoring process, it is recommended to remove legacy folders such as `Enum`, `Interface`, `Basics`, and `Shared`.

Avoid creating barrel imports (index.ts) unless it is the main root index.ts file of a plugin.

### Contextual Connections

To effectively contribute as a member of a software engineering team (and community as well!), it is crucial to establish strong contextual connections. Providing links to relevant resources can greatly assist others in understanding the context. Consider the following practices:

- Include the link to the corresponding issue in your commit message.
- Leave comments with links to the relevant context within the code.
- Whenever possible, document important information directly within the codebase itself.

By adopting these practices, you can enhance collaboration and facilitate a better understanding of the codebase within our community.

### Naming conventions

To ensure code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following guidelines:

-   Use kebab-case for both file names and folder names. If the file contains a React component, it should be in PascalCase, e.g. `SheetTab.tsx`.
-   Folder names should be in plural format.
-   Interfaces should be named starting with a capital "I".
-   Do use conventional type names including .service, .controller, .menu, .command, .mutation, and .operation. Invent additional type names if you must but take care not to create too many.

Sometimes you need to defined a dependency injection token. Please adhere to the following naming convention:

```typescript
export const IYourServiceOrControllerName = createIdentifier<IYourServiceOrControllerName>('<package-name>.<your-service-or-controller-name>.(service|controller)');
```

For example:

```typescript
export const ILogService = createIdentifier<ILogService>('core.log.service');
```

### Submitting pull requests

Before merging a pull request, please make sure the following requirements are met:

-   All tests are passed. ESLint and Prettier errors are fixed.
-   Test coverage is not decreased.

We provide preview deployments for pull requests. You can view the preview deployment by clicking the "Preview" link in the "View Deployment" section.

### Documentation

If you are adding a new feature, please make sure to update the documentation accordingly. Refer to our [documentation repository](https://github.com/dream-num/docs) for more guidance.

### Storybook

We use Storybook to develop and test components in isolation. It is a great tool to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development efficiency. You can use the following command to start Storybook:

```shell
pnpm storybook:dev
```

When a new pull request is submitted, a Storybook deployment will be automatically generated. You can view the Storybook deployment by clicking the "Preview" link in the "View Storybook" section.

### Debugging

We provided some Visual Studio Code (vscode) tasks to help you debug in vscode.

After stating dev server, you can launch Edge or Chrome instance and debug in vscode, and you can debug directly in vscode!

### Unit test

To ensure the quality of the code and move with confidence, we require that all code must be covered by unit tests. We use vitest as the unit test framework. You can use the following command to run unit tests:

```shell
pnpm test
```

With the help of vscode and its rich ecosystem, you could directly debug unit tests in vscode. Please install the extension we recommend, and you will see the debug button in the codelens.

### Clean code

> Programs are meant to be ready by humans and only icidentally for computers to execute. - Harold Abelson

-   Do not expose properties or methods those are not necessary to be exposed.
-   Group related methods or properties together. Do not always use blank lines to separate them.
-   Keep your concepts consistent by naming your variables consistently.

### New Package

Create a new package with our CLI tool:

```shell
# pnpm
pnpm create @univerjs/cli init <project-name>

# npm
npm create @univerjs/cli init <project-name>

```
